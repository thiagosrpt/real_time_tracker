**Title of the project:** Real Time Path Tracker


**Description of the project:**PATH is the subway system that connects Jersey City and Manhattan, using PATH's public API, I created markers for each station and by clicking on the marker you get to see the status and ETA for the trains at the station.

**How to Run:** Just download the PathTransit_Mapbox.html and open on the browser.

**Roadmap of future improvements:** create fuction just so the ETA and statuses of the trains will update automatically every X seconds.
