# Real ETA - NJ-NY PATH Trains

PATH is the subway system that connects Jersey City and Manhattan, using PATH's public API, I created markers for each station and by clicking on the marker you get to see the status and ETA for the trains at the station.

## Description

This is an exercise on manipulating APIs and displaying data to the user in real time. Using free API from PATH trains and Mapbox, I built this simple map with all the locations of the PATH Train Stations in NJ and Manhattan. The code works by pining the PATH API and requesting real-time ETA for each station and using Mapbox's capabilities in order to display the ETA details within a box by clicking on each marker on the map.

## Getting Started

## How to Run

Download the zip folder with the source code file and open the index.html on the browser of your choice.

## Roadmap of future improvements
- Make train ETAs update on its own every 15 or 30 seconds.
- Add status icons to popups: green for ontime, red for delayed, etc.
